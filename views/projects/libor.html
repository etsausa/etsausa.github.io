    <h2>LONG ISLAND BOARD OF REALTORS®</h2>
    <h3>WEBSITE REDESIGN AND REBRANDING</h3>

    <p>Over the past two years I’ve taken part in the efforts of developing and executing a new brand for the Long Island Board of REALTORS®. The rebranding effort was two fold. We completely redesigned the company’s brand identity, as well as redesigning the company website that 30,000+ REALTORS® use to interface with the board.</p>
    <p>Since our internal teams needed to support daily operations during the rebranding process, we enlisted the help of several agencies to help us convert membership and leadership needs into our new brand.</p>

    <p>We worked with the <a href="https://ruckusmarketing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ruckus Group</a>, a design agency, and the <a href="https://fratelli.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fratelli Group</a>, a public relations firm, to help us create a new brand identity. One of the main issues that our team identified was that part of our membership in Queens felt disconnected from the rest of the membership on Long Island. With Ruckus, we created a new logo that symbolically bridges the urban REALTORS® in Queens to the suburban REALTORS® on the island under one identity. Ruckus also developed a refreshed take on our brand's former colors, which we felt were dated for a modern association.</p>
    <p>With the new tools that Ruckus provided us, we worked with Fratelli to deploy this new brand to our membership. Our team did a complete audit of our collateral documents and digital presence. Some of my responsibilities included organizing and deploying new brand materials; developing new internal documents and marketing material; developing new email templates; and creating messaging about the brand relaunch.</p>
    <p>A major component of our brand identity was our website, which was due for a major refresh. We worked with <a href="https://www.matrixgroup.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matrix Group International</a> to develop an entirely new site from the ground up. I took part in the process from the start, by performing user research to identify problem points our users had with the current site. We relayed these findings to Matrix, who created designs based on Ruckus’ new brand identity. After several months of design and review sessions, we landed on a new look and feel for our site.</p>
    <p>While Matrix developed a new Sitefinity site, our team began the process of migration. Some of my responsibilities included, managing the video, webinar, and graphical content migration; building and developing inner pages; editing and revising landing pages; and creating messaging and tutorials for the transition between sites.</p>
    <p>We launched the new <a href="https://www.lirealtor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lirealtor.com</a> in April 2023 along with our new brand and it has been a great success.</p>
