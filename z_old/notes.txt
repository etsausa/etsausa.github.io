Hangout
UI/UX Design

We want to help connect people by making it easier to plan hangouts. We want people to spend less time alone and bored and more time having memorable experiences.

At Hangout I worked with developers to design prototypes for mobile interactions. We worked in figma to design prototypes for react native.
